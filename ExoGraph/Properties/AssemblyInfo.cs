@"ExoModel provides a rich event-driven abstraction layer over any ORM or domain model.
ExoModel allows open source libraries to extend a variety of popular ORM's, like Entity Framework or nHibernate, 
without having to be specifically designed to work with each one.
Additionally, ExoModel's eventing approach supports new programming models such as change-driven code execution,
change tracking and rollbacks, and domain events.")]
